### Report on Clustering Analysis of Mall Customer Data using DBSCAN

**** Introduction:

This report explores the application of Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm on a dataset (`Mall_Customers.csv`) containing 
information about mall customers. The goal is to identify distinct clusters of customers based on their annual income and spending score.

**** Data Overview:

The dataset includes the following columns:

- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
- Gender: Gender of the customer (removed for clustering)
- Age: Age of the customer
- Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer
- Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature

 **** Data Loading and Initial Exploration:
 
  ***Loading and Inspection

  - Loaded the dataset using pandas (`pd.read_csv()`).
  - Examined the first 10 rows of data (`df.head(10)`) to understand its structure.
  - Investigated data statistics (`df.describe()`) and data types (`df.info()`).
  - Checked for missing values (`df.isnull().sum()`), and found the dataset to be clean with no missing values.

 ****Data Preprocessing:
 
  ***Handling Categorical Data:
  
  - Converted `Gender` column to numeric using `pd.to_numeric()` (not used for clustering).
  - Dropped unnecessary columns (`df.drop("Gender", axis=1, inplace=True)`).

**** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

  ***Correlation Analysis:
  
  - Calculated the correlation matrix (`df.corr()`) to understand relationships between numerical variables.
  - Visualized correlations using a heatmap (`sns.heatmap()`), highlighting relationships between variables.

 **** DBSCAN Clustering:
 
  ***Clustering Methodology:
  
  - Implemented DBSCAN algorithm using `sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN`.
  - Defined parameters (`eps=10.5`, `min_samples=5`) to cluster customers based on their income and spending score.

**** Results and Insights:

  ***Cluster Identification:
  
  - Applied DBSCAN to segment customers into clusters and identify outliers (noise).
  - Assigned cluster labels to the dataset (`dbscan["Cluster"] = dbs.labels_`).
  - Visualized clusters using a scatter plot (`sns.scatterplot()`), distinguishing clusters with different colors and marking outliers.

 **** Conclusion:
 
In conclusion, DBSCAN clustering provided insights into different customer segments based on their annual income and spending behavior. This unsupervised learning 
technique helps businesses understand customer preferences and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

By leveraging DBSCAN clustering, businesses can enhance customer segmentation strategies and optimize resource allocation based on distinct customer behavior patterns 
observed from the data.

This analysis provides a foundational understanding of how DBSCAN can be applied to customer segmentation tasks, offering actionable insights for business decision-making 
and marketing strategies.
